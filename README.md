myanimelist
===========

MyAnimeList plugin for FlexGet

This plugin is the fruit of rewriting fuzzylighs outdated plugin.
Mostly new code this will search for the text in the anime title instead of
parsing the link with regex

The current version only allows to specify the username
'''myanimelist:
'''  username: username
If I have time I will try to code more functionality
And use a proper API like http://mal-api.com


Options to be enabled in the near future
- Choose which section to pull (by watching status)
'''list: watching|completed|planned|on-hold|dropped
- Select sorting method
sort: by name|by score|
